Fibonacci Script written in Python for my IST 402RPI course at Penn State. Project exceeds original (include print(), loops, conditionals, and classes) assignment expectations by adding exception handling for invalid inputs such as blank spaces and letters. Additionally, the program knows when only one number is entered.
